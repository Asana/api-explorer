Organizations might use this API endpoint to:\n\n* Set up proactive alerting with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool like [Splunk](https://asana.com/guide/help/api/splunk)\n* Conduct reactive investigations when a security incident takes place\n* Visualize key domain data in aggregate to identify security trends\n\nNote that since the API provides insight into what is happening in an Asana instance, the data is [read-only](/docs/get-audit-log-events). That is, there are no \"write\" or \"update\" endpoints for audit log events.\n\nOnly [Service Accounts](https://asana.com/guide/help/premium/service-accounts) in [Enterprise Domains](https://asana.com/enterprise) can access Audit Log API endpoints. Authentication with a Service Account's [Personal Access Token](/docs/personal-access-token) is required.\n\nFor a full list of supported events, see [Supported AuditLogEvents](/docs/supported-auditlogevents).\n";
