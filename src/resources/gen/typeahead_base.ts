This feature is meant to provide results quickly, so do not rely on this API to provide extremely accurate search results. The result set is limited to a single page of results with a maximum size, so you wonâ€™t be able to fetch large numbers of results.  The typeahead search API provides search for objects from a single workspace. This endpoint should be used to query for objects when creating an auto-completion/typeahead search feature. This API is meant to provide results quickly and should not be relied upon for accurate or exhaustive search results. The results sets are limited in size and cannot be paginated.  Queries return a compact representation of each object which is typically the gid and name fields. Interested in a specific set of fields or all of the fields?! Of course you are. Use field selectors to manipulate what data is included in a response."
